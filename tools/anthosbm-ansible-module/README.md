## 1. Introduction

Anthos on bare metal allows you to run Kubernetes clusters on your own hardware infrastructure and also allows you to monitor your cluster from Google Cloud Console.  Read more on Anthos on bare metal  [here](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/bare-metal/1.8/concepts/about-bare-metal).

This guide explains the steps required for creating Anthos clusters on bare metal on Ubuntu hosts and also explains steps to try it on Google Compute Engine (GCE) VMs. 


## 2. Anthos on Bare Metal Ansible Module

This module can be used for installation of Anthos on Bare Metal nodes for all kind of clusters (admin, user, hybrid and standalone).


### 2.1 Ansible Configuration file

The ansible.cfg configuration file is placed in the &lt;REPOSITORY\_ROOT>/ansible directory. This configures the inventory location and disables host checking.


```
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory/hosts.yml
host_key_checking = False
```



### 2.2 Execute Playbook

Install Ansible on Workstation and run the below command to create the Anthos cluster.


```
sudo apt install ansible

cd <REPOSITORY_ROOT>/ansible

ansible-playbook create_anthos_cluster.yml
```



## 3. Prerequisites for Anthos on Bare Metal

The complete list of prerequisites is available [here](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.8/installing/install-prereq).

Other than cluster nodes, you need a workstation machine that is used for running Anthos installation commands. It can be a GCE VM, or an on-premise VM or an on-premise physical server.  Following are the main prerequisites for a workstation:



*   Operating system is the same supported Linux distribution running on the cluster node machines.
*   More than 50 GB of free disk space.
*   L3 connectivity to all cluster node machines.
*   Access to all cluster node machines through SSH via private keys with passwordless root access. Access can be either direct or through sudo.
*   Access to the control plane VIP.


### 3.1 Google Cloud Account

You need a user account or a service account that has a Project Owner/Editor role creating the required Google Cloud resources.  Alternatively You can add the following IAM roles to the user account (or service account):



*   Service Account Admin
*   Service Account Key Admin
*   Project IAM Admin
*   Compute Viewer
*   Service Usage Admin

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```




### 3.2 OS Prerequisites

The Ubuntu OS prerequisites for all the cluster nodes including Workstation can be accomplished through**ubuntu-prereq/rhel-prereq** Ansible role. The execution of this role is controlled by the below variable in vars/anthos\_vars.yml file


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
# Possible values: ubuntu | rhel
# Use rhel for CentOS as well
os_type: "ubuntu"
```


The role execution is done from the playbook (create_anthos_cluster.yml).


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
- hosts: all
  remote_user: "{{ login_user }}"
  gather_facts: "no"
  vars_files:
    - vars/anthos_vars.yml
  roles:
    - role: ubuntu-prereq
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      when: os_type == "ubuntu"
    - role: rhel-prereq
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      when: os_type == "rhel"
```


### 3.3 Workstation Docker prerequisite

The workstation should have Docker installed and the non-root user that is used for Anthos installation should have access to the Docker. This can be achieved through the ws-docker role.


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
- hosts: workstation
  remote_user: "{{ login_user }}"
  gather_facts: "no"
  vars_files:
    - vars/anthos_vars.yml
  roles:
    - role: ws-docker
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      when: ws_docker == "yes"
```

The role execution can be controlled by the below variable.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
# Leave it blank if you would like to skip the docker installation and configuration
ws_docker: "yes"
```



### 3.4 Workstation gcloud SDK prerequisite

The Workstation should have gcloud SDK installed. You can do this using the**gcloud-sdk** Ansible role.


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
    - role: gcloud-sdk
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      when: gcloud_sdk == "yes"
```


The role execution can be controlled by the below variable.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
# Leave it blank if you would like to skip the gcloud SDK installation
gcloud_sdk: "yes"
```



### 3.5 Workstation Kubectl prerequisite

The Workstation should have the kubectl tool installed. This can be done through**kubectl-tool** Ansible role.


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
    - role: kubectl-tool
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      when: kubectl_tool == "yes"
```


The role execution can be controlled by the below variable.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
# Leave it blank if you would like to skip the kubectl installation
kubectl_tool: "yes"
```



### 3.6 Workstation bmctl prerequisite

The Workstation should have the bmctl tool installed. This can be done through**bmctl-tool** Ansible role.


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
    - role: bmctl-tool
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      when: bmctl_tool == "yes"
```


The role execution can be controlled by the below variable.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
# Leave it blank if you would like to skip the bmctl installation
bmctl_tool: "yes"
```


The bmctl download location and version is configured through below variables.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
bmctl_download_url: gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/1.6.2/linux-amd64/bmctl
```


The location of bmctl executable is defaulted to `/usr/local/sbin` which can be changed through below variable.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
bmctl_path: /home/user1/baremetal
```



## 4. Google Cloud Configuration

The Google Cloud configuration can be done from a Cloud Shell or a GCE VM Instance. If the configuration is done from the Workstation, then you should login with a Google account. You can find the required details [here](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.8/installing/install-prereq#logging_into_gcloud). 

You can configure the Google Cloud as well as create required Service Accounts using**service-accounts** Ansible role.


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
    - role: service-accounts
      when: service_accounts == "yes"
```


In case you have already created the Service Account and would like to skip this step, you can do so through the below variable.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*
 
 ```
 # Leave it blank if you would like to skip the bmctl installation
service_accounts: "yes"
```


The location for downloaded key files for Service Accounts and the names of Service Accounts are configured through below variables.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
# The Service Account Key files are stored in this location. The role that creates cluster searches this location for the key files.
gcp_sa_key_dir: /home/anthos/gcp_keys
# Below are the names of the Service Accounts created for the Anthos cluster
local_gcr_sa_name: anthos-gcr-svc-account
local_connect_agent_sa_name: connect-agent-svc-account
local_connect_register_sa_name: connect-register-svc-account
local_cloud_operations_sa_name: cloud-ops-svc-account
```


**Note:** The below bmctl command can also enable Google Cloud APIs and create the required service accounts. However, the Ansible role provides better control especially when you would like to use the same Service Accounts for different clusters.


```
bmctl create config -c [CLUSTER_NAME]
    --enable-apis \
    --create-service-accounts
```



## 5. Anthos Cluster Role

The Anthos cluster can be created using the**anthos** Ansible role.


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
    - role: anthos
```


The**anthos** Ansible role uses a number of variables in addition to the Service Accounts variables. It also uses the Inventory host file.


### 5.1 Inventory File

The IP address or the DNS names of cluster nodes including Workstation should be set in the Ansible inventory. The**cp\_nodes** contains the list of Control Plane Nodes and**worker\_nodes** contains the list of Worker Nodes.


*inventory/hosts.yml*

```
all:
  hosts:
  children:
    workstation:
      hosts:

You can use Connect Gateway for connecting to the registered clusters and run commands to monitor the workload. You can read more about Connect Gateway [here](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/gateway).


### 6.1 Configure Connect Gateway

You can configure the Connect Gateway with**connect-gateway** Ansible role. 


*create_anthos_cluster.yml*

```
    - role: connect-gateway
      when: (cgw_members is defined) and (cgw_members != None)
```


This role requires the below variable that contains a list of users and/or service accounts that can connect to the cluster through Connect Gateway.


*vars/anthos_vars.yml*

```
cgw_members: 
- user:[USER_EMAIL_ID]
- serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ID]
```



### 6.2 Validate Connect Gateway

Open Cloud Shell from the GCP console after logging in using your Google account.


```
gcloud alpha container hub memberships get-credentials [CLUTER_NAME] --project [PROJECT_ID]
```


where `[CLUSTER_NAME]` is the name of the Anthos cluster and `[PROJECT_ID]` is the Google Cloud Project ID.

Run the below command to verify that you can connect successfully to the Cluster API. 

**NOTE:** your email ID should be added to the CGW configuration.


```
Kubectl get pods -A
```

## 7 Reset Cluster

You can reset the anthos cluster using **reset_anthos_cluster.yml** playbook.

```
cd <REPOSITORY_ROOT>/ansible
ansible-playbook reset_anthos_cluster.yml
```
